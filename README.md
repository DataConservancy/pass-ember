PASS is an ember application which provides a unified user interface that allow its users to deposit their manuscripts
into multiple repositories as required by applicable funding agency's public access policies

PASS communicates with a Fedora repository on the backend using JSON-LD. See the
[ember-fedora-adapter](https://github.com/OA-PASS/ember-fedora-adapter) for more information.
Objects persisted to Fedora are automatically indexed by Elasticsearch. See
[pass-indexer](https://github.com/OA-PASS/pass-indexer) for more information about how this works.
Note that the indexing process is asynchronous. An object persisted to Fedora will not immediately be available in Elasticsearch.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/)
* [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome/)

## Installation

* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* `cd pass-ember`
* `npm install`

## Running / Development

There are two different docker configurations.

### Configuration 1

* `docker-compose up`
  * Fedora repository at http://localhost:8080/fcrepo/ (admin:moo)
  * Elasticsearch index at http://localhost:9200/pass/
  * Wait for indexer container to create the index.
  * In order to remove persisted data, stop all the containers and `docker system prune -f`
* `ember serve`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
* Visit your tests at [http://localhost:4200/tests](http://localhost:4200/tests).

### Configuration 2

In this configuration all requests must pass through a Shibboleth proxy to access services
available at https://pass/.


* In .docker/shib/ run `docker-compose up`
  * Fedora repository at https://pass.local/fcrepo/ 
  * Elasticsearch index search endpoint at https://pass.local/es/
  * Wait for containers to settle.
  * In order to remove persisted data, stop all the containers and `docker system prune -f`
* Visit your app at https://pass.local/app
* Visit your tests at https://pass.local/app/tests
* The local code runs in the`ember container.

Note that ember test will not be able to run tests which make requests to services behind
the Shibboleth proxy. The ember test client would have to go through the process of getting credentials first.

### Configuration

The configuration for the docker environment occurs in .env. See documentation on the individual
components for configuration options.

The pass-ember application configures the Fedora adapter uses these environment variables.
There are also defaults specified in config/environment.js. They tell the adapter where Fedora
and Elasticsearch are and generally will not need to be modified during development.

In order to prevent an Authorization header being sent to Fedora and Elasticsearch,
set FEDORA_ADAPTER_USER and FEDORA_ADAPTER_PASSWORD to empty strings.

### Running Tests

* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`

### Building

* `ember build` (development)
* `ember build --environment production` (production)

### Deploying

Specify what it takes to deploy your app.
