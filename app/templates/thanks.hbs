<p>
 Submission to PubMed Central (PMC), via National Institutes of Health Manuscript Submission (NIHMS), requires 2 additional steps. You will be contacted within a few days to approve the processing of your manuscripts on NIHMS. Once approved, your manuscript will be formatted for display on PMC. A final approval will be required before your manuscript is ready for publication on PMC.
